    "# Training Wheel Exercise: Renal Cancer Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Objective: \n",
    "Identifying relevant features is a common procedure in biological research (e.g gene expression and protein expression studies). Hence, comprehensive understanding of its workflow is mandatory. \n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this exercise is to provide an introduction into the conventional pipeline for pathway enrichment studies. More specifically, protein expression data will be analysed. Here, we are employing commonly-used feature selection methods e.g. t-test, recursive feature elimination, and selecting top proteins based on statistical p-value ranks. Subsequently, the frequently used hypergeometric enrichment tool will be utilised to evaluate enrichment of these protein features to pathways. \n",
    "\n",
    "The results from this exercise can also be used as a benchmark as we perform feature selection through \"fuzzy-logic\" tools in future studies. \n",
    "\n",
    "Footnote: \n",
    "This notebook also serves as a logbook for BS9001."

    "### Batch Correction through ComBat\n",
    "Biological data are often obtained in batches. Technical sources of variation across batches, can lead to heterogenity across batches of data (e.g. different experiment personnels, different experimental instruments) - also known as batch effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Batch effects can potentially confound data, and lead to discrepancies in statistical testing. Such discrepancies can obscure revelation of important explanatory variables in datasets (e.g. subpopulations). \n",
    "Hence, batch correction is often an imperative step to ensure that discoveries made from the data in question are truly meaningful and relevant.\n",
    "\n",
    "ComBat is a widely used tool and data harmonization technique for correction of batch effects in microarray expression data, through the empirical Bayes methods. In this exercise, we utilise pyComBat, a Python 3 language implementation tool of ComBaT (https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.17.995431) for batch correction of the RC data. "

    "\n",
    "In this exercise, we employ the Z-normalisation technique. This technique involves transforming each feature by subtracting its mean value and dividing by the standard deviation. The Z score exhibits the number of standard deviations away from the mean a score is. When Z is 0, the observation is at the sample’s mean. Z-normalisation can also be used to address outliers.\n",

    "## PCA: Principal Component Analysis \n",
    "Biological expression data are usually exceedingly large, with a broad number of dimensions to consider. Hence, principal component analysis (PCA) are often used as a tool to reduce the dimensionality of such datasets, in order to aid interpretation while minimising loss of information through preservation of \"variability\".\n",
    "The PCA generates uncorrelated variables that successively maximize variance, known as the principal components (PCs).\n",
    "\n",
    "The RC data contains 3123 protein features (genes), hence a PCA analysis would be appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, the PCA will be employed to identify any significant clustering in the proposed RC dataset, each for the non batch-corrected and batch-corrected data respectively. We will evaluate if the PCs are able to serve as classifiers to segregate the case and control (cancer patients vs normal patients in the RC data) through formation of distinct clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "By performing separate PCA plots for the non batch-corrected and batch-corrected data, it allows for one to compare and visualise the significance/purpose of batch correction. PCA plots can sometimes be employed to detect batch effects through identification of PCs which are highly correlated with batch, rather than class. Although, it suffers from addressing subtle batch effects which are often obscured, as addressed in this study here\n",

    "## Feature selection\n",
    "Data preparation was performed upstream, and through analyses via PCA, it is observed that both PC1 and PC2 were capable of class prediction, through generation of distinct clusters based on class effects. Batch effects contributed little to the clustering after batch correction. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, the next step is to perform feature selection to extract the most relevant features. More specifically, it is to compare and extract the variables which are strongly discriminative between two groups. In this RC dataset, we aim to perform identification of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between cancer and control patients. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, feature selection is performed at the level of the proteins. A common feature-selection workflow include the use of the two sample t-test, followed by the hypergeometric enrichment (subnet evaluation) test in order to evaluate protein enrichment in pathways. However, it is important to note that while such applications are common, it does not always guarantee the identification of high quality signatures (as cited in this study: https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~wongls/psZ/wilson-rbna2015.pdf).  \n",

    "### T-test \n",
    "The t-test is based on t-distribution. In biological studies, comparisons are often made between two populations of treatment. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the student's t-test, it evaluates whether the means of the measurement variable are different between two groups. The test statistic, ts, is calculated using a formula that has the difference between the means in the numerator; The denominator is the standard error of the difference in the means, which gets smaller as the sample variances decrease or the sample sizes increase.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Assumptions of the T-test\n",
    "Observations within each group are assumed to be normally distributed. Hence, data distribution that are non-normal should undergo normalisation. A log2 transformation was already performed prior to this. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Log2 Transformation \n",
    "The log transformation, is a widely used method to address skewed data, and are often used in biological research. \n",
    "Log2 transformation aids in conforming data to normality by reducing the skewness of the data. Log-transformed expression (or concentration) values model proportional changes rather than additive changes, which can be more appropriate for biological research (depends). \n",
